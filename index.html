        <p>I've never cried for something that wasn't directly personal but this past week has been devastating.  I'm filled with grief over the violence and religious terrorism and rape, perpetrated most often against LGBT, women, and other disempowered minorities. From a comfortable perch I silently watch the waste of life and human potential. After recent threats, I go to work hoping that if something happens, it will lead to change. The access to weapons of annihilation is appalling, that much more so by morally regressive ideologues.</p>

<p>What depraved mind accepts a crippled world view where this violence is inevitable? We have morally evolved, expanding our respect of others beyond tribal borders, our view of love outside of small minded traditions, our definition of humanity beyond measurement in fifths of a white man.</p>

<p>We must morally evolve now. Many, many times have we seen in the past century our ability to accomplish tremendous things: in society as much as in infrastructure or technology or medicine. What choice now left but to reject pervasive violent imagery, hate filled ideology, and (most easily!) access to these weapons.</p>

<p>I love you fam. I don't talk about these things much because I can't really draw an arrow to an outcome and I loathe arguing for its own sake. While I don't know if any of that is different now, I know that I'm different now. My reaction to this pain is purely compassionate. Compassion for LGBT, America, humanity, and consciousness writ large. This isn't a legal argument, but tears on a page.</p>

<p>NO MORE SORROW</p>

<p>NO MORE GUNS</p>

<p>NO MORE DOGMA</p>

<p>NO MORE RAPE</p>

<p>NO MORE HATE</p>
